This repository houses the code required to calculate the perfromance metrics of face generation models:

- VAEs
- GANs
- Diffusion Models

The different metrics in this repo include:
- Inception Score [(IS)](https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch)
- Frechet Inception Distance [(FID)](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
- Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity [(LPIPS)](https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity)
- Structural Similarity Instance Metric [(SSIM)](https://github.com/Po-Hsun-Su/pytorch-ssim)
